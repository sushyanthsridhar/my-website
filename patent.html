        <p><strong>Title:</strong> A SOLAR POWERED COOLING CHAMBER FOR STORING FARM PRODUCE</p>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The present invention generally relates to a solar powered cooling chamber for storing farm produce, having an interior space enclosing an electric power source that obtains solar energy through a solar panel. It includes a thermoelectric module that cools a plurality of compartments when powered by the electric power source. It further includes a fluid circulating means to circulate a fluid through a network of pipes that produce a cooling effect inside the storage rack. An air circulating means is provided for circulating air in the interior space through a circulation path. Here, the circulation path regulates the cooling effect and eliminates heat from the solar powered cooling chamber. Lastly, the interior space encloses a controller, which is configured to control one or more sensors, the fluid circulating means and the air circulating means. This invention is cheaper and more eco-friendly when compared to conventional storage spaces.</p>

    <!-- Background of Invention -->
    <h2>Background of Invention</h2>
    <div class="description">
        <p>Harvested farm produce needs to be stored at optimum temperature and relative humidity to prevent it from deteriorating. The conventional cold storage unit use vapor compression refrigerators. However, they consume high power and require a lot of maintenance. Thus, are unaffordable by majority of farmers. There is a need for an alternative which is cheaper and more eco-friendly and also minimizes energy consumption through usage of renewable energy.
            In the view of the forgoing discussion, it is clearly portrayed that there is a need for a solar powered cooling chamber for storing farm produce.This invention relies on solar energy for power consumption, thus bringing down the capital demand of constructing and maintaining cold storage spaces.

    <h2>Summary of Invention: Working</h2>
    <div class="description">
        <p>The present disclosure seeks to provide a solar powered cooling chamber for storing farm produce. This innovation can be used as a cold storage facility for various horticulture crops. The invention does not require any other external source of energy and is powered by photovoltaic cells.
            This invention will increase the accessibility of cold storage spaces in remote regions. It will also bring down the capital requirements to construct and maintain cold storage spaces. 
            In an embodiment, the solar powered cooling chamber for storing farm produce, having an interior space encloses an electric power source that stores solar energy that is obtained through a solar panel. The solar panel is installed on the roof of the solar powered cooling chamber. The interior space encloses a thermoelectric module that cools a plurality of compartments when powered by the electric power source. Here, the thermoelectric module is connected to a plurality of heat sinks. It further encloses a fluid circulating means to circulate a fluid through a network of pipes arranged in the interior space. Here, the network of pipes comprises of atleast one connection from one compartment of the plurality of compartments to another. Also, the network of pipes produces a cooling effect inside a storage rack that holds farm produce. The interior space further encloses an air circulating means for circulating air in the interior space through a circulation path. Here, the circulation path regulates the cooling effect and eliminates heat from the solar powered cooling chamber. Also, the circulation path comprise of one or more baffles to direct the air flow. Lastly, the interior space encloses a controller, which is configured to control one or more sensors, the fluid circulating means and the air circulating means. Here, the walls of the solar powered cooling chamber are made of an insulating material. The electric power source provides electrical power having a DC voltage to the thermoelectric module, the air circulating means and the fluid circulating means.
            In another embodiment, the thermoelectric module of the solar powered cooling chamber comprise of a plurality of peltier elements.
            In another embodiment, the fluid circulating means of the solar powered cooling chamber comprise of a pump for pumping the fluid into the plurality of compartments and the network of pipes.
            In another embodiment, the fluid used in the solar powered cooling chamber is a coolant.
            In another embodiment, the air circulating means of the solar powered cooling chamber comprise of a blower for blowing air to one of the plurality of heat sinks to promote heat dissipation.
            In another embodiment, the electric power source of the solar powered cooling chamber is a battery pack and is connected to a DC-DC converter and a voltage regulator to regulate the power supply.
            In another embodiment, the electric power source of the solar powered cooling chamber further comprises an alternate power source and an inverter.
            In another embodiment, the one or more sensors comprise of a temperature sensor and the controller is configured to receive a temperature reading from the temperature sensor and the controller is configured to initiate the air circulating means when the temperature reading rises above a predetermined temperature threshold.
            In another embodiment, one or more sensors comprise of a humidity sensor and the controller is configured to receive a humidity reading from the humidity sensor, and the controller is configured to initiate the air circulating means when the humidity reading rises above a predetermined humidity threshold.
            In another embodiment, the walls of the solar powered cooling chamber have one or more windows for ventilation and the network of pipes are arranged such that they frame inner side of the window to cool the incoming air.
            In another embodiment, the walls of the solar powered cooling chamber have one or more doors for maintenance and accessing the storage rack.
            In another embodiment, above the storage rack of the solar powered cooling chamber, a mesh structure is installed to prevent escape of cool air from the storage rack.
