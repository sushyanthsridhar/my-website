            <h2>Extension to Portfolio Report: Vaccine Distribution Optimization Using Gurobi and Greedy Heuristic</h2>
            <p>This project builds on my existing expertise in modeling dynamic systems by focusing on optimizing the distribution of vaccines across multiple locations. With the new vaccine distribution model, I showcase my ability to solve complex logistics problems using both exact optimization methods and heuristic algorithms. This addition complements previous projects like the Mosquito Population Dynamics Simulation by addressing real-world scenarios involving both biological systems and supply chain logistics.</p>

            <h3>Vaccine Distribution Optimization: Overview</h3>
            <p>The objective was to deliver three types of vaccines to 200 nodes while minimizing the total travel distance. Key constraints included vaccine-specific delivery windows, cooling requirements, vehicle capacities, and fuel limits. The model used two approaches:</p>

            <h4>Gurobi Optimization:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Applied Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to find the optimal route.</li>
                <li>Incorporated subtour elimination constraints and time-dependent delivery requirements.</li>
                <li>Ensured vaccines were delivered efficiently within fuel and capacity limits.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Greedy Heuristic:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented a nearest-neighbor heuristic to assign routes quickly by choosing the closest unvisited node.</li>
                <li>Offered a scalable solution for large datasets, focusing on speed and feasibility, though with slightly reduced precision compared to the Gurobi approach.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Impact and Complementary Skills</h3>
            <p>This project aligns well with previous work such as the Mosquito Population Dynamics Simulation, which required dynamic modeling and seasonal data analysis. Both projects required attention to time-dependent trends and resource allocation—in one case, biological populations, and in the other, vaccines and logistics.</p>

            <h4>New Skills:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Logistics optimization with Gurobi</li>
                <li>Greedy heuristics for fast, scalable solutions</li>
                <li>Handling time-window constraints and capacity limits</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Cross-Project Connections:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Similar to modeling mosquito lifecycles, the vaccine project required monitoring and managing dynamic systems over time.</li>
                <li>Both projects involved balancing multiple constraints (e.g., mortality vs. developmental rates in mosquito populations, and cooling vs. delivery windows in vaccine distribution).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Time Series Forecasting with Prophet</h2>
            <p>In this project, you implemented time series forecasting using Facebook’s Prophet model to analyze trends in product demand. The model used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Logistic growth to handle capacity constraints.</li>
                <li>Seasonal decomposition to capture multiplicative seasonal effects.</li>
