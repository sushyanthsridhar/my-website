    <h1>Stochastic Optimization for Production Planning and Resource Management</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            In this project, I led the development of a comprehensive stochastic resource allocation model to optimize planning, scheduling, and inventory management for shrimp farming operations. By integrating funnel optimization techniques and cohort analyses, I streamlined processes, resulting in a 30% reduction in production costs. The model utilized data-driven decision-making to enhance resource allocation and improve operational efficiency, allowing for more precise inventory control and better management of fluctuations in demand.
        </p>
        <p>
            To support the project's sustainability objectives, I incorporated an ammonia-based refrigeration system into the shrimp supply chain. Using stochastic programming, ETL processes, and time series analysis, I significantly increased energy efficiency, cutting carbon emissions by 50%. This integration aligned with industry environmental standards, ensuring the long-term scalability and sustainability of the supply chain while reducing energy costs and optimizing refrigeration operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also employed Gurobi to design a non-linear resource allocation model using Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) to address complex constraints in resource distribution. By implementing heuristics such as branch-and-bound, relaxation techniques, and cutting planes, I effectively minimized the optimality gap, enabling faster computation times without compromising on solution accuracy. This optimization approach allowed the model to provide scalable and efficient solutions, ensuring optimal resource utilization even under non-linear conditions and fluctuating demands.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, I applied SQL queries, Statistical Quality Control, SARIMA forecasting, and regression models to improve logistics management, allowing for precise demand forecasting and resource planning. This combination of advanced optimization tools and statistical techniques ensured that the entire supply chain remained agile, responsive, and cost-effective, further solidifying the project's success in reducing costs while enhancing both operational and environmental performance.
